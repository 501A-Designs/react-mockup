## About
react-mockup lets you create simple mockups with a single react component. This package contains three different components:
- `<WindowMockup/>`
- `<BrowserMockup/>`
- `<MobileMockup/>`

<!-- react-mockup also provides a web editor that allows you to customize your mockup visually without needing to fiddle around with the props. (The editor will generate the nessacary react-mockup component for you).
